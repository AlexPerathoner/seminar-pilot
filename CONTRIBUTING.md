## Style

There is no published style guide (yet). In general, please match the surrounding code. Our style is similar to [GitHub style](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide) with some extra principles:

- All top-level types should have access control specified.
- Group protocol implementations and subclass overrides with `// MARK:` statements.
- Column limit of 120.
- Method signatures either fit on one line, or should be broken at every param, with the closing parentheses and opening scope bracket shifted-left to match the `func` declaration. This helps Xcode.
